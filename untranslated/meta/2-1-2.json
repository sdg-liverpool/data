The data is collected using an online system into which food banks enter data from each food bank voucher, and the number of emergency food supplies is recorded. \n\nFor example, if a family of three were referred to a food bank twice in one year, this would count as six supplies on the system because it would reflect six instances of a supply going to someone in the household. However, if a family of three were only referred to a food bank once, this would count as three supplies. \n\nTrussell Trust figures cannot be used to fully explain the scale of food bank use across the UK, because figures relate to food banks in their network and not to the hundreds of independent food aid providers and community-groups also providing support. There are more than 1,300 food bank centres in the Trussell Trust\u2019s UK wide network. The Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) represents more than 500 independent food banks operating across the UK. IFAN has identified at least 1,034 independent food banks across the UK in addition to food banks in the Trussell Trust network, Salvation Army, and school-based food banks.
