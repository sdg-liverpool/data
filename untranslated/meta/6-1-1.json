Improved water sources include - piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water.\n\nIn order to meet the criteria for a safely managed drinking water service, an improved water source should meet three criteria - it should be accessible on the premises (accessibility), water should be available when needed (availability), and the water supplied should be free from contamination (quality). Many countries lack data on one or more elements of safely managed drinking water. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) provide national estimates only when data are available on drinking water quality and at least one of the other criteria (accessibility and availability).
