In national accounts, GVA is output minus intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any unit engaged in the production of goods and services. Industrial sectors are defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. \n\nThe UK standard industrial classification of economic activities, abbreviated as UK SIC, is a 5-digit classification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data according to economic activity. The current UK standard industrial classification of economic activities was completed in 2007 and effective from 01/01/2008.","UNIT_MEASURE":"Percentage (%)","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"[Regional gross value added (balanced) by industry: local authorities by NUTS1 region - UKD North West edition](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/regionalgrossvalueaddedbalancedlocalauthoritiesbynuts1region)","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"May 2021","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"Office for National Statistics","INST_MANDATE":"","OTHER_METHOD":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"GVA estimates are presented in \u2018real\u2019 terms, with the effect of inflation removed, as chained volume measures (CVM) in money terms (using 2016 values).
