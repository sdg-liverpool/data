Consequently, the classification of an individuals sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. \n\nOfficial estimates of public sector employment compiled from QPSES are generally lower than estimates available from APS. This is partially because many people who work within public sector premises, whilst being employed by private sector organizations, will classify themselves as working in the public sector, e.g. cleaners or security guards employed by a contractor to work at public sector premises.

population, the Annual Population Survey (APS) unemployed estimates within local authorities are based on very small samples so for many areas are unreliable. To overcome this, model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. \n\nThe model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes. \n\nUnemployment figures are for economic active persons aged 16 and over.\n\nData from January to December used as annual figures, for example 2004 represents Jan 2004 - Dec

This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. \n\nData on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. \n\nPresence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. \n\nData were available for 70 countries in 2017. At present, UK data does not account for homeless rough sleepers. \n\nData follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic
