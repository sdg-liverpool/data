The biogas can be used directly in engines for Combined Heat and Power (CHP), burned to produce heat, or can be cleaned and used in the same way as natural gas or as a vehicle fuel.","UNIT_MEASURE":"Watts per capita","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"[Regional Installed Capacity](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/regional-renewable-statistics)\n\n[Population estimates](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestnew)","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"To be confirmed","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Office for National Statistics","INST_MANDATE":"","OTHER_METHOD":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"Due to disaggregation not available at the local level, this data represents the North West of England as opposed to Liverpool.","DATA_COMP":"Type of Energy (in Watts)/Population","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/755a6c592a300e0319dd379e725e104778d98995","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-17: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/28f8e1072ed898c7aecc8181209fd84a25e70dd2","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-09-02: see changes on GitHub","source_organisation_1":"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2003","source_geographical_coverage_1":"North West England","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/regional-renewable-statistics","source_url_text_1":"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy - Regional Renewable Statistics","source_release_date_1":"24 September 2020","source_next_release_1":"To be confirmed","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"renewablesstatistics@beis.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"","source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"1981","source_geographical_coverage_2":"North West England","source_url_2":"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestnew","source_url_text_2":"Nomis - Population estimates - local authority based by five year age band","source_release_date_2":"25 June 2021","source_next_release_2":"1 September 2022","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"pop.info@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_2":"Mid-year population estimates used.","source_organisation_3":"","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"","source_url_text_3":"","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"","source_contact_3":"","source_other_info_3":"","source_organisation_4":"","source_periodicity_4":"","source_earliest_available_4":"","source_geographical_coverage_4":"","source_url_4":"","source_url_text_4":"","source_release_date_4":"","source_next_release_4":"","source_statistical_classification_4":"","source_contact_4":"","source_other_info_4":"","source_organisation_5":"","source_periodicity_5":"","source_earliest_available_5":"","source_geographical_coverage_5":"","source_url_5":"","source_url_text_5":"","source_release_date_5":"","source_next_release_5":"","source_statistical_classification_5":"","source_contact_5":"","source_other_info_5":"","source_organisation_6":"","source_periodicity_6":"","source_earliest_available_6":"","source_geographical_coverage_6":"","source_url_6":"","source_url_text_6":"","source_release_date_6":"","source_next_release_6":"","source_statistical_classification_6":"","source_contact_6":"","source_other_info_6":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-09-02","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-17","source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":true,"indicator":"7.b.1","target_id":"7.b","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-0b-01"}
