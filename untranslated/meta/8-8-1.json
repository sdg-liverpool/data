While the enforcing authorities are informed about almost all relevant fatal workplace injuries, it is known that non-fatal injuries are substantially under-reported. Currently, it is estimated that around half of all such injuries to employees are reported. These results are achieved by comparing reported non-fatal injuries, with results from the Labour Force Survey - Injuries.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/b83ed38f7b3491b3c6b5cba6bd72662c6e8128d0","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/6da27941b3e967d4c81532d392e0e070cc8b1760","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-08-11","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-10","indicator":"8.8.1","target_id":"8.8","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-08-01"}
