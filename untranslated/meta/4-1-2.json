Since data is around 100%, this has been extrapolated to assume that Liverpool's data will be similar.\n\nThere are many reasons why the primary and lower secondary completion rate can exceed 100 percent - the numerator may include late entrants and overage children who have repeated one or more grades of primary education as well as children who entered school early, while the denominator is the number of children at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education.\n\nThis indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/d3346ab662011622dcdcd318d84e840b8f94e464","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-17: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/8ebd41b15688a06a935cce5cab484b49bcc14408","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-09-02: see changes on GitHub","source_organisation_1":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics and The World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2015","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"The World Bank - Primary completion rate, total (% of relevant age group) - United Kingdom","source_release_date_1":"1 September 2020","source_next_release_1":"To be announced","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"uis.datarequests@unesco.org","source_other_info_1":"","source_organisation_2":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics and The World Bank","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2017","source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.CMPT.LO.ZS?end=2018&locations=GB&start=2017&view=chart","source_url_text_2":"The World Bank - Lower secondary completion rate, total (% of relevant age group) - United Kingdom","source_release_date_2":"1 September 2020","source_next_release_2":"To be announced","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"uis.datarequests@unesco.org","source_other_info_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"","source_url_text_3":"","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"","source_contact_3":"","source_other_info_3":"","source_organisation_4":"","source_periodicity_4":"","source_earliest_available_4":"","source_geographical_coverage_4":"","source_url_4":"","source_url_text_4":"","source_release_date_4":"","source_next_release_4":"","source_statistical_classification_4":"","source_contact_4":"","source_other_info_4":"","source_organisation_5":"","source_periodicity_5":"","source_earliest_available_5":"","source_geographical_coverage_5":"","source_url_5":"","source_url_text_5":"","source_release_date_5":"","source_next_release_5":"","source_statistical_classification_5":"","source_contact_5":"","source_other_info_5":"","source_organisation_6":"","source_periodicity_6":"","source_earliest_available_6":"","source_geographical_coverage_6":"","source_url_6":"","source_url_text_6":"","source_release_date_6":"","source_next_release_6":"","source_statistical_classification_6":"","source_contact_6":"","source_other_info_6":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-09-02","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-17","source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":true,"indicator":"4.1.2","target_id":"4.1","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-01-02"}
