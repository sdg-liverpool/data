Consequently, the classification of an individuals sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. \n\nOfficial estimates of public sector employment compiled from QPSES are generally lower than estimates available from APS. This is partially because many people who work within public sector premises, whilst being employed by private sector organizations, will classify themselves as working in the public sector, e.g. cleaners or security guards employed by a contractor to work at public sector premises. \n\nPublic and Private sector employment' dataset used. January to December survey periods used as annual figures.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/aa08947d9828ef7fef9660e221c37f9aaf0e9cd8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/ae28c581b84715d3b8e1c3f2ed5ce5aaa4f833e8","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-08-19","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-11","indicator":"16.7.1","target_id":"16.7","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-07-01"}
