More proactive policing in a given area could lead to an increase in crimes recorded without any real change in underlying crime trends. These issues need to be taken into account when using these data. Annual data is calculated by using the rolling 12 months to December for the year.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/aa08947d9828ef7fef9660e221c37f9aaf0e9cd8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/6bf137f185d7c6ed5f88929a2aa41c86e56a64b6","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-09-01: see changes on GitHub","source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":"2007","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Liverpool","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/recordedcrimedataatcommunitysafetypartnershiplocalauthoritylevel","source_url_text_1":"ONS - Recorded crime data at Community Safety Partnership and local authority level","source_release_date_1":"25 April 2019","source_next_release_1":"Discontinued","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"","source_url_2":"","source_url_text_2":"","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"","source_contact_2":"","source_other_info_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"","source_url_text_3":"","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"","source_contact_3":"","source_other_info_3":"","source_organisation_4":"","source_periodicity_4":"","source_earliest_available_4":"","source_geographical_coverage_4":"","source_url_4":"","source_url_text_4":"","source_release_date_4":"","source_next_release_4":"","source_statistical_classification_4":"","source_contact_4":"","source_other_info_4":"","source_organisation_5":"","source_periodicity_5":"","source_earliest_available_5":"","source_geographical_coverage_5":"","source_url_5":"","source_url_text_5":"","source_release_date_5":"","source_next_release_5":"","source_statistical_classification_5":"","source_contact_5":"","source_other_info_5":"","source_organisation_6":"","source_periodicity_6":"","source_earliest_available_6":"","source_geographical_coverage_6":"","source_url_6":"","source_url_text_6":"","source_release_date_6":"","source_next_release_6":"","source_statistical_classification_6":"","source_contact_6":"","source_other_info_6":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-09-01","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-11","source_active_1":true,"indicator":"16.1.3","target_id":"16.1","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-01-03"}
