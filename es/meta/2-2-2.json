Overweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Body mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height. It is defined as a person\u2019s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m\u00b2). The BMI classification of each child is derived by calculating the child\u2019s BMI centile. This calculation uses age and sex as well as height and weight to take into account different growth patterns in children at different ages.","UNIT_MEASURE":"Percentage (%)","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"[Public Health Profiles - Reception: Prevalence of underweight](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/underweight#page/4/gid/1/pat/6/ati/301/are/E08000012/iid/90316/age/200/sex/4/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0)\n\n[Public Health Profiles - Reception: Prevalence of overweight (including obesity)](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/national-child-measurement-programme#page/4/gid/8000011/pat/6/par/E12000002/ati/301/are/E08000012/iid/20601/age/200/sex/4/cid/4/tbm/1)","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"Public Health England","INST_MANDATE":"","OTHER_METHOD":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/5ab41789de7732e574b286ac3efdf5f2f6a9f4f0","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/30694617b0498acf421b6ea5f910d8542ef8bb38","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-09-01: see changes on GitHub","source_organisation_1":"Public Health England","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2007/08","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Liverpool","source_url_1":"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/underweight#page/4/gid/1/pat/6/ati/301/are/E08000012/iid/90316/age/200/sex/4/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0","source_url_text_1":"Public Health Profiles - Reception: Prevalence of underweight","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"","source_other_info_1":"Data acquired from the National Child Measurement Programme","source_organisation_2":"Public Health England","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2007/08","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Liverpool","source_url_2":"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/national-child-measurement-programme#page/4/gid/8000011/pat/6/par/E12000002/ati/301/are/E08000012/iid/20601/age/200/sex/4/cid/4/tbm/1","source_url_text_2":"Public Health Profiles - Reception: Prevalence of overweight (including obesity)","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"","source_other_info_2":"Data acquired from the National Child Measurement Programme","source_organisation_3":"","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"","source_url_text_3":"","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"","source_contact_3":"","source_other_info_3":"","source_organisation_4":"","source_periodicity_4":"","source_earliest_available_4":"","source_geographical_coverage_4":"","source_url_4":"","source_url_text_4":"","source_release_date_4":"","source_next_release_4":"","source_statistical_classification_4":"","source_contact_4":"","source_other_info_4":"","source_organisation_5":"","source_periodicity_5":"","source_earliest_available_5":"","source_geographical_coverage_5":"","source_url_5":"","source_url_text_5":"","source_release_date_5":"","source_next_release_5":"","source_statistical_classification_5":"","source_contact_5":"","source_other_info_5":"","source_organisation_6":"","source_periodicity_6":"","source_earliest_available_6":"","source_geographical_coverage_6":"","source_url_6":"","source_url_text_6":"","source_release_date_6":"","source_next_release_6":"","source_statistical_classification_6":"","source_contact_6":"","source_other_info_6":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-09-01","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-09","source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":true,"indicator":"2.2.2","target_id":"2.2","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-02-02"}
