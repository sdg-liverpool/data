  We have identified the following policies and frameworks relevant to this
  indicator - 


  [Climate Change Strategic Framework,
  2009](http://www.greeninfrastructurenw.co.uk/liverpool) -
  this document brings together the members of Liverpool First in a commitment
  to make Liverpool an environmentally responsible, thriving international city
  for the future. 


  Liverpool signed up to the [European Covenant of
  Mayors](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/eu-adaptation-policy/covenant-of-mayors)
  carbon target in 2017. 


  Liverpool City Council is currently on target to cut its carbon emissions by
  42% by 2020 since 2005. Key to this achievement includes a policy of only
  buying green energy, installing 27,000 LED street lights across the city,
  investing in solar panels in major venues such as at ACC Liverpool and
  introducing ultra-low emission vehicles into its fleet. 


  Liverpool declared a Climate Change Emergency in July 2019 and target to reach
  a net zero carbon position by 2030.
