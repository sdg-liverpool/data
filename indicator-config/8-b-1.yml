  **Non-statistical indicator**


  In 2019, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) scored the UK in band 3
  for this indicator. This is the highest score available, and signifies that
  the UK has operationalised a national strategy for youth employment. This
  score was based on relevant UK policies that were supplied to the ILO and a
  biennial questionnaire. 


  We have identified the [Education and Skills Act
  2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/contents) as a relevant
  policy for this indicator.
