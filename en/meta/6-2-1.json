Since UK data does not disaggregate to local level, and statistics are close to 100%, it has been assumed that Liverpool data would mirror this.\n\nA framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. \n\nData on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. \n\nPresence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. \n\nData were available for 70 countries in 2017. At present, UK data does not account for homeless rough sleepers. \n\nData follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/78e95a47ef55816b0934dd9643824c97f251db56","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/287e6989f3e7fe86b9761aaa46069f2009906788","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-09-02: see changes on GitHub","source_organisation_1":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2000","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=water_treat#","source_url_text_1":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - Wastewater treatment (% population connected)","source_release_date_1":"1 March 2018","source_next_release_1":"To be announced","source_statistical_classification_1":"Not classified","source_contact_1":"ENV.Stat@oecd.org","source_other_info_1":"","source_organisation_2":"","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"","source_url_2":"","source_url_text_2":"","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"","source_contact_2":"","source_other_info_2":"","source_organisation_3":"","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"","source_url_text_3":"","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"","source_contact_3":"","source_other_info_3":"","source_organisation_4":"","source_periodicity_4":"","source_earliest_available_4":"","source_geographical_coverage_4":"","source_url_4":"","source_url_text_4":"","source_release_date_4":"","source_next_release_4":"","source_statistical_classification_4":"","source_contact_4":"","source_other_info_4":"","source_organisation_5":"","source_periodicity_5":"","source_earliest_available_5":"","source_geographical_coverage_5":"","source_url_5":"","source_url_text_5":"","source_release_date_5":"","source_next_release_5":"","source_statistical_classification_5":"","source_contact_5":"","source_other_info_5":"","source_organisation_6":"","source_periodicity_6":"","source_earliest_available_6":"","source_geographical_coverage_6":"","source_url_6":"","source_url_text_6":"","source_release_date_6":"","source_next_release_6":"","source_statistical_classification_6":"","source_contact_6":"","source_other_info_6":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-09-02","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-11","source_active_1":true,"indicator":"6.2.1","target_id":"6.2","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-02-01"}
