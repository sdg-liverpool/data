To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. The model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes. Unemployment figures are for economic active persons aged 16 and over.","UNIT_MEASURE":"Percentage (%) of economically active","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"Regional labour market: Modelled unemployment for local and unitary authorities","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"14/09/2021","DATA_SOURCE":"Office for National Statistics","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","OTHER_METHOD":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"Data from January to December used as annual figures, for example Jan 2004 - Dec 2004 represents 2004.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/9775cb690e4dc5cb921b6b9773d0843f46e6530d","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/499fe1a14cb9071663a8297f3ac063a4613c8d3d","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-08-11","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-10","indicator":"8.5.2","target_id":"8.5","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02"}
