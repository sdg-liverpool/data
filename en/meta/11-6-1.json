Also included are amounts rejected for recycling, composting or reuse where incineration with EfW is reported as the final destination of these rejects. \n\n'Recycled-composted' includes household and non-household sources sent for recycling or for centralised composting; home composting estimates are not included in this total. It also includes small amounts of materials sent for reuse.
