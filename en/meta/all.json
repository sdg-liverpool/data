To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. The model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error.

Many countries lack data on one or more elements of safely managed drinking water. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) provide national estimates only when data are available on drinking water quality and at least one of the other criteria (accessibility and availability). Regional and income group estimates are made when data are available for at least 30 percent of the population.

La l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional se fija actualmente en 1,90 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda a precios internacionales de 2011.\n\n## Conceptos:\nAl evaluar la pobreza en un pa\u00eds determinado y la mejor manera de reducirla, naturalmente uno se enfoca en una l\u00ednea de pobreza que se considera apropiada para ese pa\u00eds. Pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo hablamos de manera significativa sobre \"la pobreza global\"? Las l\u00edneas de pobreza entre pa\u00edses var\u00edan en t\u00e9rminos de su poder adquisitivo y tienen un fuerte gradiente econ\u00f3mico, de modo que los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s ricos tienden a adoptar niveles de vida m\u00e1s altos al definir la pobreza. Pero para medir consistentemente la pobreza absoluta global en t\u00e9rminos de consumo, necesitamos tratar a dos personas con el mismo poder adquisitivo sobre los productos b\u00e1sicos de la misma manera - ambos son pobres o no lo son - incluso si viven en pa\u00edses diferentes.\n\nDesde el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, el Banco Mundial se ha propuesto aplicar un est\u00e1ndar com\u00fan para medir la pobreza extrema, anclado en lo que significa la pobreza en los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s pobres del mundo. El bienestar de las personas que viven en diferentes pa\u00edses se puede medir en una escala com\u00fan ajustando las diferencias en el poder adquisitivo de las monedas. Para el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, se eligi\u00f3 el est\u00e1ndar de 1 d\u00f3lar al d\u00eda, medido a precios internacionales de 1985 y ajustado a la moneda local mediante PPA, porque era t\u00edpico de las l\u00edneas de pobreza de los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos en ese momento. A medida que evolucionan las diferencias en el costo de vida en todo el mundo, la l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional debe actualizarse peri\u00f3dicamente utilizando nuevos datos de precios de PPA para reflejar estos cambios. El \u00faltimo cambio fue en octubre de 2015, cuando el Banco Mundial adopt\u00f3 $ 1,90 como l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional utilizando la PPA de 2011. Antes de eso, la actualizaci\u00f3n de 2008 estableci\u00f3 la l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional en $ 1,25 utilizando la PPA de 2005. Las medidas de pobreza basadas en l\u00edneas de pobreza internacionales intentan mantener constante el valor real de la l\u00ednea de pobreza en todos los pa\u00edses, como se hace al hacer comparaciones en el tiempo. Las primeras ediciones de los Indicadores de desarrollo mundial (WDI) del Banco Mundial' utilizaban las PPA de las Penn World Tables para convertir los valores en moneda local al poder adquisitivo equivalente medido en d\u00f3lares estadounidenses. En ediciones posteriores se utilizaron estimaciones de la PPA de consumo de 1993, 2005 y 2011 elaboradas por el Programa de Comparaci\u00f3n Internacional (PCI) del Banco Mundial'.","UNIT_MEASURE":"","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":""},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-07-19","national_data_updated_date":"2021-07-19","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/cf7b3226a2b96830c9e1af0b924bd5b0c85aed9f","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/cf7b3226a2b96830c9e1af0b924bd5b0c85aed9f","indicator":"1.1.1","target_id":"1.1","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-01-01"},"3-2-1":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Infant mortality rate","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"Infant mortality rate","indicator_name":"Under\u2010five mortality rate","indicator_number":"3.2.1","national_geographical_coverage":"Liverpool","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"SDG_INDICATOR_INFO__GLOBAL":"","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under\u20105 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Indicator 3.2.1: Under\u2010five mortality rate","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF)","CONTACT_NAME__GLOBAL":"","ORGANISATION_UNIT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_FUNCT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_PHONE__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_MAIL__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_EMAIL__GLOBAL":"","IND_DEF_CON_CLASS__GLOBAL":"","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.","UNIT_MEASURE__GLOBAL":"Rate per 1,000 live births","CLASS_SYSTEM__GLOBAL":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"","INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL":"","OTHER_METHOD__GLOBAL":"","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"The data is based on a 3 year average.

The biogas can be used directlyin engines for Combined Heat and Power (CHP), burned to produce heat, or can be cleaned and used in the same way as natural gas or as a vehicle fuel.\n\nCalculations - Type of Energy (in Watts)/Population","UNIT_MEASURE":"Watts per capita","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SRC_TYPE_COLL_METHOD":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"Regional Installed Capacity","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"To be confirmed","DATA_SOURCE":"Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","OTHER_METHOD":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"Due to disaggregation not available at the local level, this data represents the North West of England as opposed to Liverpool.","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/c1b9e78d6a7ff19e77c8136ffabb695775e6d011","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-08-17: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-liverpool/data/commit/ef674197a4e48690b46c062ea16cdc0c4fbe3cfe","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-17: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-08-17","national_data_updated_date":"2021-08-17","indicator":"12.a.1","target_id":"12.a","sdg_goal":"12","indicator_sort_order":"12-0a-01"},"3-9-3":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Age-standardised mortality rate per 100,000 persons","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_available":"Accidental poisoning by and exposure to noxious substances","indicator_name":"Mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning","indicator_number":"3.9.3","national_geographical_coverage":"Liverpool","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"SDG_INDICATOR_INFO__GLOBAL":"","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"Indicator 3.9.3: Mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","CONTACT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_NAME__GLOBAL":"","ORGANISATION_UNIT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_FUNCT__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_PHONE__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_MAIL__GLOBAL":"","CONTACT_EMAIL__GLOBAL":"","IND_DEF_CON_CLASS__GLOBAL":"","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 population are standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population.

Consequently, the classification of an individuals sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. Official estimates of public sector employment compiled from QPSES are generally lower than estimates available from APS. This is partially because many people who work within public sector premises, whilst being employed by private sector organizations, will classify themselves as working in the public sector, e.g. cleaners or security guards employed by a contractor to work at public sector premises.
