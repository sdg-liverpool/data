  A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been
  developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation
  Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation
  sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1.
  Data on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries.
  However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates
  of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. Presence of a handwashing
  station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members
  consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most
  suitable proxy. Data were available for 70 countries in 2017. At present, UK
  data does not account for homeless rough sleepers. Data follows the UN
  specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in
  collaboration with topic experts.

  This data represents the United Kingdom as opposed to Liverpool. Since UK data
  does not disaggregate to local level, and statistics are close to 100%, this
  has been extrapolated to assume that Liverpool data would resemble this.
