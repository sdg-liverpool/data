  Children with low weight for age are known as underweight. Overweight and
  obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Body mass index
  (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height. It is defined as a person’s weight in
  kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²). The BMI
  classification of each child is derived by calculating the child’s BMI
  centile. This calculation uses age and sex as well as height and weight to
  take into account different growth patterns in children at different ages.
