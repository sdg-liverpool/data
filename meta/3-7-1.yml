  Data is not representative of the uptake of contraception methods across the
  whole population. Contraceptives can be obtained from other sources such as
  GPs or direct from pharmacies, whilst non-prescription items like condoms can
  be obtained easily without a visit to a medical specialist.


  For analysis of contraception methods it is encouraged that data be presented
  as proportions rather than numbers. This is because the level of SRH service
  provision is constantly changing.
