  'Disposal Method' refers to the waste management type.


  Landfill estimates include recycling, composting or reuse rejects.


  'Incineration with EfW' - EfW is energy from waste. Also included are amounts
  rejected for recycling, composting or reuse where incineration with EfW is
  reported as the final destination of these rejects.


  Recycled-composted' includes household and non-household sources sent for
  recycling or for centralised composting; home composting estimates are not
  included in this total. It also includes small amounts of materials sent for
  reuse. Material which was collected for recycling but actually rejected at
  collection, by the MRF or at the gate of a recycling reprocessor is excluded.
  The percentage of waste recycled shown above relate to all Local Authority
  collected waste and so are different to local authority “household” recycling
  rates or the slightly narrower “waste from household” definitions. The [Annual
  Results
  tables](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results)
  provide further statistics and detail on these.


  'Other' includes waste treated or disposed through other unspecified treatment
  processes as well as process and moisture loss.
