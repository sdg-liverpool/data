  Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter.
  These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and
  therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from
  respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular
  diseases.
