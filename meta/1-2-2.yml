  The percentage of people who are living in households which are deemed at risk
  of poverty in the national context. Monitoring national poverty is important
  for country-specific development agendas. National poverty lines are used to
  make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country’s specific
  economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international
  comparisons of poverty rates.
