  Police recorded crime statistics, like any administrative data, are affected
  by the rules governing the recording of data, systems in place and operational
  decisions in respect of the allocation of resources. More proactive policing
  in a given area could lead to an increase in crimes recorded without any real
  change in underlying crime trends. These issues need to be taken into account
  when using these data. Annual data is calculated by using the rolling 12
  months to December for the year.
