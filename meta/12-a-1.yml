  Solar PV - The direct conversion of solar radiation into electricity by the
  interaction of light with the electrons in a semiconductor device or cell. 


  Bioenergy - renewable energy made from material of recent biological origin
  derived from plant or animal matter, known as biomass. 


  AD - Anaerobic Digestion is a natural process in which microorganisms break
  down organic matter, in the absence of oxygen, into biogas (a mixture of
  carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane) and digestate (a nitrogen-rich fertiliser).
  The biogas can be used directlyin engines for Combined Heat and Power (CHP),
  burned to produce heat, or can be cleaned and used in the same way as natural
  gas or as a vehicle fuel.
