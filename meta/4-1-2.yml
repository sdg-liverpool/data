  Primary and lower secondary education completion rate is measured as the gross
  intake ratio to the last grade of lower primary/secondary education. It is
  calculated as the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the
  last grade of primary/lower secondary education, regardless of age, divided by
  the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary/lower
  secondary education.

  There are many reasons why the primary and lower secondary completion rate can
  exceed 100 percent - the numerator may include late entrants and overage
  children who have repeated one or more grades of primary education as well as
  children who entered school early, while the denominator is the number of
  children at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education.


  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
  Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global
  indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration
  with topic experts.

  Due to disaggregation not available at the local level, this data represents
  the whole of the United Kingdom of England as opposed to Liverpool. Since data
  is around 100%, this has been extrapolated to assume that Liverpool's data
  will be similar.
