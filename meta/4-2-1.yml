  The EYFSP is a teacher assessment of children’s development at the end of the
  early years foundation stage (the end of the academic year in which the child
  turns five years old – this is typically at the end of the Reception year).


  Children are assessed in three prime areas of learning (communication and
  language, physical development and personal and social emotional development)
  and four specific areas of learning (expressive arts and design, literacy,
  mathematics, understanding the world).


  Children achieving a good level of development are those achieving at least
  the expected level within communication and language, physical development,
  personal and social emotional development, literacy and mathematics.


  Children achieving at least the expected level across all early learning goals
  (ELGs) are those achieving ‘expected’ or ‘exceeded’ in all 17 ELGs.
