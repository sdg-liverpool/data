  Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services
  produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. In national accounts,
  GVA is output minus intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any
  unit engaged in the production of goods and services. Industrial sectors are
  defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic
  activities. 


  The UK standard industrial classification of economic activities, abbreviated
  as UK SIC, is a 5-digit classification providing the framework for collecting
  and presenting a large range of statistical data according to economic
  activity. The current UK standard industrial classification of economic
  activities was completed in 2007 and effective from 01/01/2008.

  GVA estimates are presented in ‘real’ terms, with the effect of inflation
  removed, as chained volume measures (CVM) in money terms (using 2016 values).
  Therefore percentages will not add up to 100%.
