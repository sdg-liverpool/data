  Functional green space is defined as any green space that has a specific
  function in its use, for example, public parks or gardens, playing fields,
  golf courses, allotments etc. These spaces contain natural land cover, and can
  also include some blue space, for example, a park that has a lake within it.
  Publicly accessible functional green space is defined as a subset of
  functional green space, it removes green spaces expected to have restriction
  to entry, for example, golf courses. Restrictions to entry limits the ability
  of the green space to provide cultural services. Publicly accessible green
  space includes parks and public gardens, playing fields, cemetery and
  religious grounds.

  Estimates for the extent of green space in urban areas have been developed
  through collaborative work between the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
  and the Ordnance Survey (OS) . This indicator is being used as an
  approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to
  identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

  Sites labelled as ‘parks and public gardens’ are very likely to be public,
  however ‘playing fields’ may be private land or require payment to enter. Both
  are included in the figures provided.
