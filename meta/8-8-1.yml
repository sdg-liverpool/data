They do not allow for different regional price levels or changes in prices over time (inflation). \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nGVA estimates are also presented in \"real\" terms, with the effect of inflation removed, as chained volume measures (CVM) in indices (2018 equals 100) and in money terms (using 2018 values).\t\t\t\n\t\nBalanced estimates are produced by combining the existing income and production approach measures using weighted quality metrics (published separately).\t\t\t"

  Injury estimates are not presented for the self-employed, due to severe
  under-reporting (under-reporting also affects employee reports but to a lesser
  extent than for the self-employed). 


  While the enforcing authorities are informed about almost all relevant fatal
  workplace injuries, it is known that non-fatal injuries are substantially
  under-reported. Currently, it is estimated that around half of all such
  injuries to employees are reported. 


  These results are achieved by comparing reported non-fatal injuries, with
  results from the Labour Force Survey - Injuries.

  Data from RIDREG - RIDDOR reported fatal and non-fatal injuries in Great
  Britain by country, region and unitary or local authority (.xlsx).


  The Annual Population Survey (APS) is the source of employment data used as
  the denominator for rates of injury in these tables. The rate is constructed
  by dividing the count of injuries by the employment estimate. This is then
  multiplied by a factor of 100,000 to give a rate per 100,000 workers, in line
  with international standards.
