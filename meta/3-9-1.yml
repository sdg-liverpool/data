  Fraction of annual all-cause adult mortality attributable to anthropogenic
  (human-made) particulate air pollution (measured as fine particulate matter,
  PM2.5). Mortality burden associated with long-term exposure to anthropogenic
  particulate air pollution at current levels, expressed as the percentage of
  annual deaths from all causes in those aged 30+. PM2.5 means the mass (in
  micrograms) per cubic metre of air of individual particles with an aerodynamic
  diameter generally less than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 is also known as fine
  particulate matter.
