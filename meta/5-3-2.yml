  Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) refers to “all procedures involving
  partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to
  the female genital organs for non-medical reasons” (World Health Organization,
  Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation - An interagency statement, WHO, UNFPA,
  UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008,
  p.4). The World Health Organisation defines the four types of female genital
  mutilation as follows - Type 1 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral
  glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive
  part of the female genitals, with the function of providing sexual pleasure to
  the woman), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the
  clitoral glans). Type 2 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and
  the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of
  the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva). Type 3 - (Often
  referred to as infibulation). Narrowing of the vaginal opening with the
  creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning
  the labia minora, or labia majora. The covering of the vaginal opening is done
  with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans (Type
  I FGM). Type 4 - All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for
  non-medical purposes, for example pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and
  cauterization.
