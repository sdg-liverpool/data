  Due to disaggregation not available at the local level, this data represents
  the North West of England as opposed to Liverpool. Respondents of the survey
  were asked about the quality of public services in their country rather than
  region or local authority, however the data represents the response from
  individuals in the North West.


  Data are collected from the Eurofound 'European Quality of Life Survey'.

  Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global
