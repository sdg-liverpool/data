  Gender pay gap is based on the percentage difference between median wages. The
  workplace population in a local authority is defined as the population whose
  usual place of work is in that local authority, including individuals who live
  and work in the local authority and individuals who work in the local
  authority but commute from a home elsewhere within England or Wales. The
  resident analysis refers to those who reside in the local authority, however
  the workplace does not have to be within the same local authority.
