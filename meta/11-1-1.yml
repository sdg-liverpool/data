  A person is considered homeless if they have no accommodation in the UK or
  elsewhere. A person is also homeless if they have accommodation but cannot
  reasonably occupy it, for example because of a threat of violence.’ Rough
  sleeping is defined as people sleeping or bedded down in the open air (such as
  on the streets, in doorways, in parks or bus shelters), people sleeping in
  buildings or other places not designed for habitation (such as barns, sheds,
  car parks, cars, derelict boats, stations or “bashes”).
